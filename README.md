Background: 

This project examines hospital occupancy trends in California to understand how inpatient and ICU bed usage has evolved over time, particularly for respiratory diseases like COVID-19 and Influenza.

Key Questions:

1. How have hospital occupancy rates for inpatient and ICU beds evolved over time in California?
2. How do hospital occupancy rates differ across different respiratory diseases (e.g., COVID-19, Influenza)?
3. How do the demographics differ across COVID-19 admissions in California?
Additional Questions:

Key Metrics (KPI'S):
Occupancy Rates: Occupancy rates by inpatient and ICU beds over time.
Admission: Admission counts for COVID-19, Influenza, and RSV.
Patient-level: Demographic data of admitted patients (age)

Key Insights:
- In late 2020, SARS-CoV-2 variants drove inpatient bed occupancy to 35%, which remained high into the following year, but by November 2021, higher vaccination rates and the milder Omicron variant saw fewer admissions.
- COVID-19 dominated ICU Bed Occupancy due to the need for more intensive car requiring mechanical ventilation  but Influenza showed seasonal spikes during the winters where Influenza is very prevalent.
- Dominance of Adult Admissions: The graph shows that a significant majority of COVID-19 admissions are for adults, with approximately 98% of the total admissions. This indicates that adults are much more likely to be hospitalized with COVID-19 compared to pediatric patients.
