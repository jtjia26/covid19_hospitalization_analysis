Background: 

This project examines hospital occupancy trends in California to understand how inpatient and ICU bed usage has evolved over time, particularly for respiratory diseases like COVID-19 and Influenza.

Key Questions:

1. How have hospital occupancy rates for inpatient and ICU beds evolved over time in California?
2. How do hospital occupancy rates differ across different respiratory diseases (e.g., COVID-19, Influenza)?
3. How do the demographics differ across COVID-19 admissions in California?
Additional Questions:

Key Metrics (KPI'S):
Occupancy Rates: Occupancy rates by inpatient and ICU beds over time.
Admission: Admission counts for COVID-19, Influenza, and RSV.
Patient-level: Demographic data of admitted patients (age)
